        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
          AirBNB took the hotel industry by storm, travelers who previously would
          depend on motels or hotels were able to utilize a home sharing service similar to uber.
          With the onset of Covid-19, the home sharing industry crashed, but the thirst
          for adventure remains!

        <h3>What is Campy?</h3>
        <p>
          Campy is a platform that enables users to share their outside property for weary travelers.
          In a similar way to how you would rent an AirBNB. Campy enables you to find and check for
          available locations and schedule a time where you can camp out on private property without
          fear of being hasseled.
          On the flip side!
          Campy empowers users to share their yards and driveways to service people who find themselves
          displaced or just passing through and in need for a temporary place to camp. Campy is
          great for homeowners or campgrounds.
