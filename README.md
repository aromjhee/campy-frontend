# Introduction

Campy is a full stack application that demonstrates a concept of sites similar in nature to Campendium, Boondockers, and to an extent, AirBnB. Users can browse, schedule and manage stays at hosted locations. Hosted locations are privately owned places where campers can pull up, hook up, and chill out for free. The app utilized a Python/Flask backend and a ReactJS frontend.
